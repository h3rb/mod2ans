MOD2ANS
-------

This package contains 1 PHP script which will convert a 4 channel mod
into a 3 channel ANSI music code sequence.  No sample data is used
because the target format only uses FM tones.

Note: lots of P8s at the end indicate empty patterns in the tail end
which is common in MODs.  Do your own editing after it is converted.

Feel free to modify this script, I ask only that you do not remove
the credits.

TODO:

 - smartly mix >= 4 channels down to 3
 - add more control for time signature based on better mod file
   time interpretations
   (data is available inside the .txt files sent with this file)
 - support older 15 channel mods (See notes in source about how
   to detect this using two 4 byte sequences)

I used this with PTMID3 (an old DOS utility that converts MIDI->MOD,
which has source code that is available and can be gathered from
ftp://ftp.us.scene.org)
